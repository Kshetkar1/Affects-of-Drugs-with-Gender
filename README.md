# Affects-of-Drugs-with-Gender
Abstract:

Diabetes is an issue that is increasing the Readmissions rate in hospitals in the United States. Its an issue that is not properly solved. More people are being readmitted back into hospitals due to the hospitals lack of care and quality when initially discharging their patients. Physiologically speaking, the male and female body have vastly different metabolisms, different body compositions, and different hormonal balances. Given the difference between the 2 types of bodies, I am looking at real patient data, from the UCI machine learning repository dataset, and their prescriptions to predict the insulin levels to see if the different levels of Insulin and other drugs affects if you have Diabetes or not based on if you are taking Diabetes Medication.
